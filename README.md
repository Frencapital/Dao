# Frencapital DAO project

## Definitions

### Founders
The first four participants in the DAO.

## Goal & Values

Frencapital is a DAO created to invest together in medium to high risk crypto projects. By doing this in a DAO we reduce risk and transaction costs. Other than that we can learn from each others expertise. 

Finally it might be a way to attract some capital in order to do larger investments that we could not do individually.

## Summoning
This DAO will be created by depositing into a multisig wallet on the ethereum mainnet. All investments will be done from the multisig wallet. The founders will control the multisig and will pledge to sign transactions according to the will of the DAO as a whole and more particular conform the results of snapshot votes.  

As transaction costs are high a governance token and contract will be launched on an L2 or a cheap L1 to enable us to vote on proposals using a snapshot page and an ENS name. 

The first four participants will get a five percent bonus in governance tokens. The governance tokens represent the ownership of the DAO and are tradeable between participants. 

The governance contract will not be directly coupled to the multisig wallet in order to avoid potential security issues. 

## Participation
In order to participate you need to transfer at least 1 eth to the multisig. After which the multisig will mint tokens in accordance with  your share in the new size of the capital. We will use zapper.fi to track the capital of the DAO and determine the share you shall receive.

Initially this will be a manual process in order to avoid complexity. Eventually a proposal can be submitted to automate this process.

## Exit
As this is a long term project, exiting is only possible by selling your governance tokens (your share) or through a successfull proposal.

## Things to do

- Receive wallet addresses of founders
- Design and deploy NFT images and data to IPFS
- Create multi sig
- Buy ENS domainname from multisig
- Choose l2 or fantom for governance token contract
- Deploy contract
- Test stuff
- Decide if we want to mint some tokens for the DAO itself in order to fund development of twitter / community / marketing / hnnmw.
